You are a dataset domain classification expert. 
Analyze the dataset samples provided as DataFrame-like structures 
and determine their primary domains with optional alternatives. 
Choose ONLY from the following domains: {domains}

{format_instructions}

Rules:
1. For each test dataset, primary_domain: SINGLE most appropriate domain (MUST be from list)
2. alternative_domains: 0-2 other relevant domains (only if applicable)
3. Use EXACT domain names
4. Output a JSON object with 'results' array containing one object per test dataset in order!
5. No additional text/comments!
